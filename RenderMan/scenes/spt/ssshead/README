prman ssshead.rib

PRMan incremental path tracing of a head with subsurface scattering.
The subsurface scattering type is beam diffusion and single-scatter.
The head is a single subdivision surface and has large displacement
and texture maps.  It is illuminated by two area lights and a bounce
card.  If the skin color looks funny, switch your display to EXR mode.
Render time is less than two minutes on an 8-core machine.
