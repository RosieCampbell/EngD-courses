prman satlight.rib

An example of non-physical rendering for artistic purposes.

This shows how to produce a light source that appears to alter the color
saturation of any objects that are in shadow from it.  It combines several
features -- light groups, light path expressions (LPEs), and an imager
shader with the readaov() shadeop -- in order to achieve the effect.

The result is shown in the it3 framebuffer with incremental rendering
to demonstrate that all this works "live", rather simply as a final
post-process effect.

Try adjusting the shift parameter on the Imager line in the RIB to see
different degrees of saturation adjustments.  Recommended values are
between -2.0 and 2.0.
