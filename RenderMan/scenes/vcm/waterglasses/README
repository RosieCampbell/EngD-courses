This example shows how Attribute "trace" "intersectpriority" can be used 
in conjunction with Attribute  "shade" "indexofrefraction" to simplify the 
modeling of "nested dielectric" scenes. 

In such scenes, a ray encounters a number of different media boundaries 
(air/glass, glass/water, water/air) and each boundary requires computation 
of the relative index of refraction to determine the refraction direction.  
The renderer tracks the priorities of objects encountered as the ray
transits the scene.  Only the current highest priority object is actually
shaded. When a ray exits a material, the new highest priority object depends
on the path the ray has taken through the scene.  This information is
coupled with the indexofrefraction to respond to the glass shader's request
for the "outside IOR" which forms the basis of the refraction direction
computation.

In this example, PxrGlass is used to model three different materials (glass,
water and airbubble). The settings for these materials are found in
waterglasses.look.rib.

To run this example simply type:
